# CI CD

**Continuous integration** : merge code changes to a central repository for automated building and testing.
AWS provides EC2 resources to support these activities (on-demand instances, reserved instances, spot instances).

**Continuous delivery** : changes in code are built, tested and prepared automatically for production release.
With well implemented continuous delivery, the developers are always in possession of a deployment-ready object that has
passed through a standard process.

**Continuous deployment** : automatically deploys revisions to a production environment without asking the developer to 
do that, and thus, makes the software release mechanism automatic. The automated deployment enables continuous customer 
feedback, which is critical in the product lifecycle.
